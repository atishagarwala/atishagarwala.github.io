I recently got [interviewed](https://stanfordcehg.wordpress.com/2018/11/19/fellows-feature-atish-agarwala/) for
my [CEHG](https://cehg.stanford.edu/) fellowship. Really happy with how it turned out (in large part due to my editor,
Sophia Naylor). Thanks to Katie Kanagawa for facilitating.

I think it's important for scientists to be able to communicate their work to a broad spectrum of audiences, and it's great
to have an opportunity to do so for a non-scientific audience. The act of having to sit down and think about how to describe
my research and its context in the simplest way possible was very valuable to me.

It was also really touching to see the reactions of family and friends who read the interview. Many were happy to get a glimpse
into my life, and others were excited about my research. My PhD has been a long road, and as I near the end, it's nice to be
able to share a bit about my journey with the people I'm closest too.
