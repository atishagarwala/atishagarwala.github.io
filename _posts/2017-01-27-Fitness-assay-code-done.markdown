Just publicly released my fitness assay code!

[https://github.com/barcoding-bfa/fitness-assay-python](https://github.com/barcoding-bfa/fitness-assay-python)

This is essentially the first bit of science I've done that's been published, and my first time releasing code into the wild.
Kind of cool to see the first successful project of my PhD actually out there.

In case you're interested in reading the paper, you can find it [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.002). Basically
I helped develop ways to analyze data on abundance of different subtypes of yeast in order to figure out which ones were
better, and by how much. That paper is more of a methods one, but we have a more sciencey one in the works where we use this
analysis to figure out (or attempt to figure out!) how exactly the adaptive subtypes are gaining an advantage. I'll post
about that when it comes out, look for it around March!
