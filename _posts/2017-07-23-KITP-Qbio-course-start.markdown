First blog post in a few months, was pretty busy with the wedding (and then a lot of relaxing after that). Thought I'd try
to start up the blog again while I'm at the [2017 KITP QBio course](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/qbio/2017-course-description).
Goal will be to write 2 posts per week with thoughs, interesting discussions, and ideas for the project.

Since not much has happened yet, I'll include some pictures of the Munger Residence, a new fancy building meant to house
KITP visitors in a kind of collaborative work/play/living space.

Main entrance.

Lots of chalkboards around, kind of a dream setup for a theorist.

Also (at least) two very nice pianos.

![Dining room](/images/dining_room.jpg)

Super fancy dining room.
