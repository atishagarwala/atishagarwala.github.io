Second week is about to start. We'll do some DNA extraction and sequencing later in the week, but until then I'll look through
the data. Thought I'd use this space to try to plan out what I want to do. I tend to feel a bit overwhelmed when first getting
a new dataset, not knowing what to do first. Feel additionally stressed about this one, because we have a time constraint for
the course, and I think I'm feeling a little more pressure/competetiveness to do something good. We'll see how that turns out.

## Visualizing the data

Guilhem, Paul Rainey's grad student, had put together some nice visualizations of some of the sequencing data. I think my first
goal is to recreate/extend that. What I want to do is make a script that does the following, given a particular dataset as
input:
* Gives me the overall average coverage and the distribution of coverage

In addition, if I have time I may want to make a data exploration tool which lets me put in a contig number

## Evolutionary scenarios

## Later analyses

Analyses I want to get to later in the week once I have a better sense of the data include:

** Gap analysis. ** I want to
